*Myntra clone.*


First of all, I want to thank the Red and White Multimedia Education for giving me this opportunity to work on a collaborative project and enhance my coding skills.
I learned a lot while working on this project. I failed so many times and I never give up, in the last I finally made Mine Project successfully.

**In the construct Iek.**

This is Mine first collaborative project from the  Red and White Multimedia Education, and I got only 15  days  to complete it, 
so it was a challenging journey for me. I faced a lot of challenges because I don’t work before on any collaborative project and 
I have to complete it on time, so I first decide to study Mine Ibsite and then do work. I learned a lot while working together, 
I failed a lot of times but I never give up, I used to help each other solve the problems of Mine project, and in the last, I finally made Mine project successfully.

**Description of Project.**

**Collaboration tools.**

*Git and Github.*

Git: Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing sMinece code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
Github: GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers the distributed version control and sMinece code management functionality of Git, plus its features.
https://github.com/Priyanshjain21-gl/Priyanshjain21-gl.git this is Mine project git hub link.
I all became proficient in reading the code of team members. and I learned How to work and communicate with a team. and how to keep motivated each other throughout the problems.
**At last, I would like to thank Mine mentors and my team members for their support & guidance during the project.**
